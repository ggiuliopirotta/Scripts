HDP performs much better on a corpus that is less processed. By less processed, I mean:
    - Not filtered for stop words
    - Not lemmatized
    - Not stemmed
    - Not enriched with multigrams
    - Not filtered for common/uncommon words

There's quite a difference between batch and non-batch (I also saw a paper mentioning this, so cite it).
I guess that's because of the "gradient descent"
